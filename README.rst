 ORTEC scientific benchmark tools for loadbuilding
===================================================

The goal of the `ORTEC Scientific Benchmark platform`__ is to let people work on more practical combinatorial optimization problems. 
In order to allow you to get right to solving them, several Python tools have been developed to view and analyze instances and solutions. 
This package is specific for the loadbuilding benchmark instances and provides in short the following functionality:

* Instance

  * File-type Conversion tool
  * Data Validity Checking tool
  * Find Applicable Constraints and Objectives tool
  
* Solution

  * File-type Conversion tool
  * Validation tool
  
* Solution Viewer tool
